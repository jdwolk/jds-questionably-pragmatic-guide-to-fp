Each lesson is a markdown file in a subdirectory

Right now the examples aren't really "executable" per se - you need to copy/paste them into a running
`node` session in CLI. This is how they were intended to be evaluated

Each subdir is also a full `yarn` project. This was mostly so I'd have `ramda` + other
dependencies in that CLI session
